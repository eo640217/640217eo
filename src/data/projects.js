It does so by reviewing the severity of the illness and the time that the patient came to the ER. Each patient that arrives at the hospital provides his/her name( first name, last name and ID) to the triage nurse, who also assesses the patient and then determines the medical problem and the priority level (i.e how severe the medical issue is). Once accepted into the hospital the patient is tagged with an arrival order.",
